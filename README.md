# df--
Simple shell script to print out actually human-readable space of a drive.

# Usage
Currently, the script will prompt the user for the default drive upon the first run. Afterwards, the default drive can be changed in:

```
~/.config/df--/default.cfg
```

Afterwards, the script will always run with the default drive as the parameter.
To see the free space for another drive, simply pass its full path as an argument.
